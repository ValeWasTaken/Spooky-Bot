Curious as to possible new features for Spooky Bot? Want to recommend your own addition? 
Or best of all, maybe you want to contribute code to Spooky Bot?

Regardless, here's a list of current feature ideas that have yet to be implemented into Spooky Bot!

- Crypto price checker / helper
  This would let the user check the price of any noteworthy cryptocurrency (or at least the top 3-10).
  It could also perhaps give additional details such as price change percentage or the ability to 
  convert prices of one crypto currency to another. So for example 1 BTC = ?? LTC.
  It should also ideally list the top 10 currencies and a summary of their data.
  
 - Currency converter
  Could perhaps handle the crypto currency conversion from above instead.
  Mainly should be able to convert between most common currencies and accept their symbols (such as $).
  
 - Music player
  This is a big one that has a ton of different possibilities to explore. Such ideas might include:
    - Radio player
    - Song request
    - Playlist player
    - Spotify integration
    - Playing YouTube music videos
    - Playing soundcloud songs
    - And much more.
    
- Meme assistant
  Could take inputs such as "!meme feelsGoodMan" and then upload a picture to the channel of the meme.
  Could allow meme creation, such as "!makememe goodguygreg 'borrows $5' 'pays you back $10'"
  
- Remind Me functionality
  Similar to the bot on Reddit and other places, lets the user ask to be reminded 
  at a set time, perhaps with a description. So for example : 
  "!remindMe 3 days 'Check PO box'"
  
- Auto mod phrases / phishing links / unwanted words
  Warns the user, deletes the message, kicks them, bans them, whatever the admin/mod wants.
  
- Role color change
  Allows the user to change the color of their role.
  
- <subject> facts
  This one is really easy to implement, it's just a matter of gathering facts.
  Find a bunch of facts about cats, dogs, history, whatever. Put it in a list and 
  then Spooky Bot can call from it with !<subject> facts.

- Time checker
  Ideally not only could a user check the current time for their timezone, but also expand this 
  command to handle all kinds of inputs like time between dates and timezone conversion.
  
- Screenshot a website
  Allows the user to ask a bot to screenshot a website and upload the result. 
  This would likely have to be only on a list of approved websites to reduce trolling.
  
- Flip text
  Flips the text given upside. Maybe also offer other text effects like Zalgo.
  
- Dictionary definiton of words
  Just like urban dictionary, but for normal words.
  
- XKCD
  Generate a particular or random XKCD comic.

- IMDB assistant
  Return IMDB results for a movie's plot, rating, trailer, etc.
  
- Starboard
  Implement a system to allow channels to have their own #star-board like in discord.gg/vale
  
- Cleverbot interaction
  Allows the user to talk to Cleverbot or something similar.
  
- Akinator interaction
  Allows the user to play the Akinator game.
  
- Omegle chat intercation
  Allows Omegle users to chat inside the channel. Should allow variables such as setting topics, 
  the ability to kick users, and so forth.
  
- 8 ball
  Pretty straight forward, just add a magic 8 ball function that would work similar to f_facts.py
  
- Impersonate
  Use Markov chains to generate sentences based on what a person has said in the past.
  
- Point system
  Similar to used on Twitch. Allow users to generate points for posting / being in the server / 
  typing a command every X amount of time. Let them use these points to duel each other, 
  play roulette, or other fun games.
  
- Leaderboard system
  - Record post count, time in server, points, and so forth.
